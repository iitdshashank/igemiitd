    <h4>Welcome to our Education & Outreach page for the 2023 IGEM project.</h4> <br> In addition to innovating, our hardworking team set out this year to inform, motivate, and involve a wide range of audiences. We've been busy on several fronts, from our "Expanding Horizons" workshop in Abu Dhabi to our "Catalysing Curiosity" programme that sparks students' interest in learning in the classroom. Our "Bridging the Gap" programme, which helps the economically disadvantaged and the visually impaired access scientific information, exemplifies this core philosophy.
    
    </p>
<p>
    We have made remarkable achievements in building a thriving and inclusive scientific community, whether through our "Bioremediation Conclave" or by partnering with prestigious institutions, as we have investigated the enormous potential of biosurfactants in addressing heavy metal toxicity. Come along with us on this educational adventure!
</p>
<p>
Education is a top priority in India because of the country's status as a developing nation. Because of this, it was essential to spread the word about how heavy metal toxicity in India's rivers directly results from the country's rapid industrialisation and the potential strategies to mitigate this issue.

                                        Our team at IIT Delhi has developed an impactful poster targeting the general public, especially our student community, to raise awareness about heavy metal toxicity. Strategically placed in key locations, the poster contains a QR code that leads to our detailed pamphlet, accessible here. This resource delves into the dangers of heavy metal poisoning caused by metals like lead, mercury, and arsenic found in everyday elements such as air, water, and consumer products. Exposure can result from various sources, including contaminated seafood, lead pipes, and certain medications. The health consequences are severe, ranging from fatigue and headaches to severe disorders like cancer and neurological issues. Early detection through medical tests is crucial for appropriate treatment. Our initiative aims to equip the community with knowledge to act proactively against heavy metal exposure.
