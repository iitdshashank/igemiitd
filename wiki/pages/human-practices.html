<p>Hair loss following chemotherapy treatments is a phenomenon that occurs to more than 60% of patients<sup>[<a href="#ref1">1</a>]</sup> . Beyond the physical
    difficulty, the loss of hair is accompanied by great mental stress. Many patients affirm that losing their hair
    makes coping with the disease much harder. Since our project deals with a very sensitive topic, our human practices
    focused on the question of how our project can <b>contribute to the community</b> and how can we <b>work together</b>    to create a fitting solution to the problem.</p>

<p>In terms of <b>understanding our impact on society</b>, we contacted different associations not only to hear and understand

<h2 id="HP">Silver Human Practices </h2>
  <hr>
  <p>On this page, we have discussed the issue that the iGEM IIT Delhi’s 2023 team is trying to solve, along with its impact and a detailed description of the stakeholders we’ve worked with, who have helped us understand the issue better. Adding onto our last year’s project LEADer, this year we are working on tackling the problem of heavy metal poisoning in the Yamuna River and controlling oil spill levels in soils. We first identified the issue, and then we listed the stakeholders who might be important in this area. Through a thorough brainstorming session with the entire HP team, we identified all pertinent parties to this issue. We identified the relevant industries, academic institutions, local communities, etc. who could give us better insights into the real world scenario. We strongly identify with the statement, “Local People Solving Local Problems”. 
    We have explained how we applied stakeholder feedback to our project in detail on the Integrated Human Practices page.
    </p>
    <br>

    <h2><b>Problem Identification:</b></h2>
  
    <p> IIT-Delhi started the project by considering the possibility of finding a substance capable of removing all types of heavy metals from water, including organometallic complexes, which significantly contribute to heavy metal pollution. This aspiration arose from the successful completion of the team’s previous project “LEADer,” which tackled the issue of lead poisoning in water bodies. However, the severity of the hazardous effects of heavy metal poisoning does not stop at Lead. </p> <br>
    <p>
    The adverse effects of heavy metals on human health include but are not limited to, impaired cognition, neurological disorders, developmental issues, and various diseases affecting the kidneys, lungs, bones, and cardiovascular system. For instance, lead exposure alone was estimated by the Institute of Health Metrics (IHME) in 2019 to be responsible for 62.5% of developmental and intellectual disability, 8.2% of hypertensive heart disease, 7.2% of ischemic heart disease, and 5.65% of stroke cases globally. Furthermore, heavy metals increase the risk of cancer.  These metals are categorized as priority elements in public health studies due to their systemic toxicity, causing damage to multiple organs even at lower levels. Moreover, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has classified them as carcinogens.
 </p> <p> These statistics highlight the severity of the situation and underline the urgency for change.</p>
    


   <p> The persistence of heavy metals in the environment for extended periods exacerbates their disastrous consequences. These metals enter water bodies through various anthropogenic channels, including mining and smelting activities, sewage and industrial waste discharge, and the excessive use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides. Natural processes like volcanic eruptions and rock weathering also contribute to their presence in aquatic ecosystems. Once in water bodies, heavy metals hinder the growth and development of aquatic life, disrupt reproductive processes, and can even be fatal. Additionally, they exhibit biomagnification throughout the food chain, spreading their toxicity to higher trophic levels. 
  </p>
  <p>
    After discussing this issue with doctors, industrial experts, and pollution-causing industries, we found out that oil spills are a major cause for soil pollution. According to a 2021 report by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), there are an estimated 1 million oil spills on land each year, releasing around 4 million tonnes of oil into the environment. 
    </p>

  <h5>
   <b> Oil spills in soil can have a variety of impacts, including:</b></h5>
  
  <p>
    <b> Harm to soil health: </b> 
    Oil can coat soil particles, preventing oxygen and water from reaching plant roots and soil microorganisms. This can lead to a decrease in soil fertility and plant growth. A study of the Exxon Valdez oil spill found that soil respiration rates decreased by up to 90% in the most heavily oiled areas. This suggests that the oil spill significantly impacted soil microbial activity, which is essential for soil health.
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>
    Contamination of groundwater:</b>  Oil can seep into groundwater supplies, making them unsafe to drink. <br>
    <b> Harm to wildlife:</b>
    Oil can poison and kill wildlife, such as birds, mammals, and reptiles. <br>

    <b> Economic losses:</b> 
    Oil spills can damage crops, livestock, and other economic resources. A study of the Kalamazoo River oil spill estimated that the spill caused $1.2 billion in economic losses, including damage to crops, livestock, and tourism.
    
  <p> The severity of these impacts underlines the urgency for change. By addressing the grave issue of heavy metal pollution and oil spills, our project aims to restore the health and vitality of these ecosystems. We hope that our efforts will not only create a positive impact but also inspire others to join the cause and create a ripple effect towards a cleaner and safer environment for all.
  </p> 
    
  <h2> Impact:</b></h4></h2>
  <p>
  A local river present near our institute, Yamuna is severely polluted, and one of the many reasons behind the pollution is Heavy metal waste which is being dumped into the river by the industries built around it. Due to this, not only the aquatic life of the river is affected, but also the people living around the river as their livelihood depended on it, like fishermen etc and the purity of the drinking water has deteriorated.
</p>
<p>
  50 years ago, the Yamuna River was a pristine source of water. It was so clean that it was not only suitable for drinking but also for cooking. Fast forward to today, due to pollution and contamination, the Yamuna's water quality has deteriorated significantly. Drinking water from the river is now unthinkable, and daily usage for households has become impractical. Hence we at iGEM IIT DELHI, found this local problem very severe and it also matched with iGEM’s motto “Local people solving local problems”.
  
</p><p>
  To understand the severity of the problem better, we interacted with the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), where we came to know that the major reason behind the pollution is discharge from industries, partially treated or untreated sewage, and agricultural waste. They also told us that the water of the Yamuna is not fit for agricultural purposes and the cost to purify it to make it available for drinking purposes has increased drastically. They also emphasized on the need for industries to adhere to CPCB's stringent guidelines for effective heavy metal treatment.
</p><p>
  In our interaction with the locals living around the Yamuna river, we came to know that the decline in the water quality of the Yamuna has had direct repercussions on the fish's health. A fisherman told us about visible changes in the fish: deformities, unusual colors, and a generally unappetising appearance, which affected his overall business. The livelihood of the locals around Yamuna directly depended on it as their source of income and hence, they have faced a decrease in their income.
</p><p>
  We conducted surveys, both at the local and international levels, to assess public awareness regarding water contamination from heavy metals and its impact on both our health and the ecosystem.
  Our domestic survey targeted the Indian public, primarily students aged 18-22. 6.1% of the people surveyed felt that this problem was important enough to be tackled. Only 27.7% of people had their water supply checked for any heavy metal contamination or any dissolved solids. 90.8% of people believed that there was heavy metal poisoning in their states.
  The Global Survey helped us understand the level of awareness of people in different countries. This information helped us to identify areas of growth for awareness in the Indian Context and to establish scope of iGEM IITD’s work in geographies other than the home location, i.e., beyond India.
</p>
<p>
  Our this year’s iGEM project aims to reduce the high concentration of Heavy metals in water bodies by using Biosurfactants. We try to tackle the issue of pollution in Yamuna river due to the heavy metals. The main aim to improve the aquatic fauna and flora of the river, to help the local people that are affected by this pollution like the fishermen whose livelihood depends on it and the people who use the water for their daily use.

<h2> <b> Identifying Stakeholders:</b></h2>
<p>
After having a proper understanding of the issue and the extent of its impact, we had to consider which additional individuals might be relevant to our project. As a result, we identified stakeholders across a range of industries through a thorough brainstorming session with the entire Human Practices team. The interactive stakeholder identification map, which shows the flows between the sectors and provides a complete aerial view of the stakeholders pertinent to our project, serves as an illustration of interactions between the sectors. We suggest that future iGEM teams adopt this strategy because it gives us a clear picture of all the key players in our project and their interdependencies. By using the literature and our impressions of each stakeholder during the interviews, we were able to identify each one of them as well as their values. You can learn more about each stakeholder by clicking on their name, as well as why we engaged them, why they are important to our project, and what their core values are.
</p>
<p>
By identifying stakeholders with a vested interest in addressing the issue of heavy metal contamination in water, we have formed vital connections for the development and real-world implementation of our solution. In this identification process, we considered the following criteria:
</p>
<p>
 <b> 1. Expertise in Our Relevant Scientific Fields:</b> This encompasses professionals knowledgeable in biosurfactants, environmental science, bioremediation, heavy metal chemistry, and water treatment.
<br>
 <b> 2. Expertise in the Issue:</b> We sought out individuals with expertise related to heavy metal contamination in water, such as researchers and practitioners in water quality and environmental health.
<br>

  </p>
<p>
  <b>
    3. Regulators and Policy Makers:</b> Individuals responsible for formulating and enforcing water quality regulations and policies play a crucial role in combating heavy metal contamination. Engaging with regulators and policymakers is essential for navigating the legal and regulatory framework governing water treatment and pollution control.
 
</p>

<p>4. <b> Industries Affected by Heavy Metal Contamination:</b> Industries dealing with heavy metals and water pollution are pivotal stakeholders. Understanding their practices, challenges, and needs for managing heavy metal waste is essential. Their input can guide the development of solutions tailored to industry requirements.
  </p>

  <p>5.<b> Local Communities and the General Public:</b> Individuals affected by heavy metal contamination in their water sources are indispensable stakeholders. Their experiences and local insights can help customize our biosurfactant solution to address specific regional challenges and ensure community acceptance.
  </p>


  <p>6. <b>Environmental Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs): </b>NGOs dedicated to environmental conservation and improving water quality are valuable collaborators. Working with these groups can provide insights into local issues and garner support and advocacy for the goals of our project.
  </p>

<h2> <b> Stakeholders Management</b></h2>

<p>A power interest matrix is used to manage all stakeholders properly and prioritize the most affected stakeholders. Hence, stakeholders are categorized according to their Power (their capacity to impact our project and strategy) and Interest (their concern about our project's success). Distinct action plans are then implemented for each quadrant to effectively handle these stakeholders.</p>
<p>Image 3</p>

<p><b>High Power, Highly Interested people</b>
  These stakeholders require meticulous management, as they play a pivotal role in the project's success. Any actions or advancements we undertake will be closely relayed to them, and we will actively seek and consider their input. Their significance to the project cannot be overstated, necessitating consistent and transparent communication.
 </p>

<b>Wastewater Treatment Facilities
</b><br>
<b> Scientific Community
</b><br>
<b>IIT Delhi
</b>
<br><br>
<p><b>High Power, Less interested people</b> 

  These stakeholders can be effectively managed through regular progress updates rather than daily communication. They should be kept informed about the project's advancements and can be valuable resources if their expertise or essential equipment is required.
 
</p>
<b>Regulators and Policy Makers </b> <br>
<b>Industries Affected by Heavy Metal Contamination</b> <br>
<b>World Health Organisation(WHO)</b>
<br><br>

<b>Low Power, Highly Interested People</b> <br>
These individuals are interested in our project but have limited influence. We can keep them informed through emails or newsletters and leverage their support to boost social media engagement.

<b>Environmental Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs)</b> <br>
<b>People living on the Banks of Yamuna or directly using its Water</b>

<br><br>
<p>
  <b>Low Power, Less interested people</b>
We will only get in touch with these people if we require their expertise in a specific area. Their input will be taken into account when needed.

</p>
<b>General Public</b>

<hr>
<h2> <b></b> Value-Sensitive Analysis</b></h2>

<p>We are committed to engaging society in the engineering design process to effectively meet their needs. We firmly believe that for new technology to gain acceptance in society, it is essential to listen to, assess, and incorporate the perspectives and context of users and society into the design process. This approach is known as consumer-driven product design, which has a proven track record of better satisfying user needs.
</p>
<p>
This is why, while working on our project Remedix, we made it our utmost priority to proactively consider the human values of the people who are directly affected by our problem, our stakeholders, throughout the decision-making process.
</p>
<p>
During this project, we have discovered that for a project to be both beneficial and responsible for the world, it's crucial to strike a balance. This became evident during our value-sensitive analysis, where we realized that different stakeholders have diverse values, resulting in different design requirements. These requirements can sometimes conflict, and our aim is to fulfill the design requirements of all involved parties in a way that the benefits outweigh the costs.
</p>
<p>
We've learned that it's not always possible to meet the needs and interests of every stakeholder completely. Therefore, it's essential to prioritize which stakeholders, values, and design requirements are most critical, possibly using tools like a power-interest grid. The goal is to meet these needs in a manner that leaves all stakeholders satisfied. This equilibrium is a principle that the entire iGEM community should consider when involving stakeholders in their project design. We suggest that future iGEM teams focus on prioritizing design requirements and satisfying the most relevant stakeholders first, rather than attempting to address all requirements.

  Addressing misconceptions about synthetic biology and biosurfactant research is essential to prevent unfounded fears and opposition, emphasizing the importance of clear and transparent communication.
The accessibility and adoption of biosurfactants may vary among countries, potentially contributing to disparities in pollution control practices, which public organizations should consider in their policy and regulatory efforts.

</p>
<br>
<br>

<h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2>
<p>After engaging in extensive dialogues with various stakeholders across diverse sectors, as evidenced in our comprehensive human practices documentation, we have reached the consensus that our project, Biosurf, possesses substantial potential for utility. By thoroughly considering the input from our stakeholders and maintaining complete transparency about our project, we have developed a project with the capacity to bring about significant positive change in both the wastewater treatment and oil spill industries. Our regular interactions with stakeholders have not only provided valuable insights into the real-world aspects of the problem and its potential solutions but have also enlightened us on the importance of selecting an optimal solution that addresses the concerns of all stakeholders, including those whose issues often go unheard. Throughout this process, we have remained committed to promoting STEM and its practical applications whenever and wherever possible. As a complementary objective, we have also taken on the task of facilitating individuals to pursue STEM education.
  As we progressed through the project and consulted with various experts, academics, and individuals from established organizations, we encountered several new challenges related to our project. We dedicated ourselves to addressing these issues, and in doing so, we came to grasp the genuine significance of Human Practices work. This approach enabled us to gain a profound understanding of the underlying causes of the problem, its varied impacts on different segments of the population, and the practical realities of existing strategies to combat these issues. It became abundantly clear that without engaging with stakeholders, we would have been unable to attain the depth of comprehension necessary for our solution to be as successful and efficient as it is. This experience underscored the vital role of Human Practices work and highlighted that, for any problem to be effectively resolved, conducting human practices work is of paramount importance.

<p>Our vision is to make <b>Angel Roots</b> an <b>off-the-shelf</b> product that will be an exclusive solution for patients undergoing
    chemotherapy, as well as to promote future research regarding decursin and its effects. For this reason, we consulted
    with <b>top experts from both the industry and the academy</b> to understand which areas we should focus on in order
    to reach the full potential of our project.</p>

<p>Our talk with Dr. Eid <b>shaped the way we communicated our project to potential clients</b>. We changed our phrasing
    and made sure to address them with the required sensitivity when compared to a more scientific background. For future
    implementation and large-scale manufacturing, we contact “Shamna” company to understand the related regulation and standards,
    and as a result of the conversation, we identified a need for a model to assess the validity of our biomanufacturing
    system. </p>

<p>We toured “Pharmaseed” Ltd. which introduced us to the process of clinical screening and offered to perform the screening
    for us. In addition, we understood we must prioritize the production of the molecule and the research of its molecular
    mechanism (see <a href="{{ url_for('pages', page='results') }}#ef">efficacy assays</a>).</p>


<p>As we continued consulting with different specialists, we had to let go of planned directions and make compromises accordingly,
    for instance, our choice to proceed with HPLC for decursin detection and giving up on previous ideas such as NMR and
    lyophilizer, thus <b>closing the loop</b> between the designed and the desired.</p>

          <p> 
          In our endeavour to address the critical issue of heavy metal pollution in the environment and its impact on human health, we conducted surveys to assess public awareness. These surveys were designed to efficiently collect and quantify data, aiming for a high response volume.
        </p>
        <h5>ASSESS</h5>
          <p>
          We conducted surveys, both at the local and international levels, to assess public awareness regarding water contamination from heavy metals and its impact on both our health and the ecosystem.The surveys that we conducted in India and Abu Dhabi aimed to determine the public awareness of heavy metal poisoning among people.
        </p>
         <h5> RESPONSE</h5>
         <p>
          The surveys were made for achieving multiple objectives. They helped us establish a baseline understanding of public awareness, enabling targeted awareness campaigns. 83 % of people were unaware of any governmental policy or action to combat heavy metal contamination. Only 27.7 % of people had their water supply checked for any heavy metal contamination or any dissolved solids 90.8% of people believed that there was heavy metal poisoning in their states. Many people seemed largely unaware of synthetic biology and its applications.

However, there's a significant lack of awareness among the locals regarding the role of heavy metals in this issue. To address this, our Education and Outreach and Human Practices teams are dedicated to raising awareness among citizens.

        Pooja Singh is a Professor at Symbiosis International (Deemed University) in the Symbiosis School of Biological Sciences. She specialises in Biodegradation and Environmental Microbiology, and has experience characterising multiple biosurfactants for biodegradation. 
        Right now, our project is all about using biosurfactants to clean up metals and oils in  landfills and wastewater. We're trying to understand how to characterise our biosurfactants once they are produced.

        Using biosurfactants can get expensive, but we're trying to cut costs by using organic waste materials. We're crunching numbers on stuff like how much we can produce, what it costs, and how big we can scale up.

        We got some great advice from Dr. Pooja Singh. She suggested playing with the Carbon Nitrogen ratio in our mix and even using AI tools for optimizing the media. She stressed the importance of testing how well these biosurfactants work in different situations and keeping our specific project needs in mind. If we're dealing with E. coli, she reminded us to double-check the water quality, maybe use solutions without live cells, and add a safety feature like a kill switch.

        Dr. Singh also gave us practical ways to measure how much biosurfactant we're making, like using a Tensiometer or doing drop collapse, FTIR, ICP-OES and oil displacement tests. Some of these tests have been done by us, which can be viewed in our results page. The goal is to make sure our biosurfactants are super effective, and we can tell that only by quantifying multiple properties of it.

             <p> During our talk, in the context of planning the production of biosurfactants using E. coli DH5α with a tunable bidirectional promoter, Prof. Zia, emphasised the significance of beginning the process of growing GMO cells with a batch culture, a traditional approach in microbial production, for planning production of biosurfactants using E. coli DH5α with a tunable bidirectional promoter. He highlighted the strategic use of IPTG for biosurfactant induction given its capacity to imitate allolactose and activate the lac operon, ensuring a regulated initiation of biosurfactant production. He also emphasised the significance of using nutrient-rich media to promote optimal cell development. Prof. Zia provided additional context for the procedure by highlighting the importance of switching to an exponential fed-batch mode before the culture enters the stationary phase, which is a crucial step in achieving High Cell Density Culture (HCDC) and greatly improving the efficiency of biosurfactant production. When requested to elaborate during the discussion's assessment phase on the significance of switching from a batch culture to an exponential fed-batch mode, Prof. Zia did so. He described this change as a tactical move, highlighting its effectiveness in creating a High Cell Density Culture (HCDC), which is essential for significantly increasing biosurfactant output. He emphasised further that the majority of the biosurfactants might be preserved in the medium by decreasing the nutrient-rich media during this transition, enriching the end result. Additionally, he presented the idea of using Dead-end filtration as a successful technique for cell separation, an analysis that was in line with optimising the bioprocess for better results.

            <h5>RESPOND</h5>
             <p> Prof. Zia emphasised that the strategy provides a concentrated amount of cells that can be employed as an inoculum to kick off the subsequent phase of production. By applying this strategy we found out no additional purification is required for the media enriched with biosurfactants that result from this stage. This strategy is economical and has the potential to significantly lower overall production costs, aligning with the principles of responsible and sustainable production.

          <h5>CONTEXTUALIZE:</h5>
          <p>Stakeholder Background and Relevance: C. Sivapathasekaran, a staff scientist at Cytiva, possesses expertise in Bioprocess optimisation and Upstream and downstream processing. His insights are vital concerning bioreactor scaling, bioprocess optimisation, and industries employing biosurfactants.
            Biosurfactants are important. Biosurfactants are used in a variety of industries, including pharmaceuticals and the cleanup of oil spills. For many industries, their production and optimisation are essential.
            
            </p>
          <h5>ASSES:</h5>
           <p>Bioprocess Optimisation: The O factor (oil-solubility or oil-affinity factor) can be used to adjust variables for the generation of biosurfactants, such as pH. It is simpler to determine the impact when most factors remain constant and only one (like pH) is changed. Artificial intelligence can make the procedure even more efficient by reducing the number of test instances.
            Challenges in Scaling Up: Foam generation in bioreactors is a key problem that needs to be effectively managed when scaling up. The foundation for scaling is lab-scale data, but there are regulatory obstacles, particularly for medicinal applications.
            
            </p>
          <h5>RESPOND</h5>
           <p>Bidirectional promoters in Scaling Up: In biotechnology, bidirectional promoters are useful tools that help with the manufacturing of particular therapies. For instance, a firm at IIT Madras uses bidirectional promoters to genetically edit bacteria to produce insulin. These promoters provide a means of increasing the effectiveness of biotechnological procedures.
            Finding Useful Biosurfactants: Making sure a sample only creates the desired biosurfactant and not any additional variants owing to mutations is essential. To distinguish the biosurfactant from other compounds, use a control medium.
            Disposal and adherence to regulations: It is crucial to dispose of things properly even without a kill switch. Samples can be disposed of safely using acidic solutions and then burning. Documenting the length of sample storage before disposal is also crucial.
            
            </p>
          <h5>EMPLOY</h5>
          <p>
            Applications for biosurfactants include the cleaning up of marine spills, cream-type cosmetics, and pharmaceuticals, where they play a part in the treatment of cancer and as antimicrobials. Their versatile nature makes them invaluable in diverse sectors.

            <h5>Contribution</h5>
            <p>They explained that there are currently two main methods for extracting from plants: steaming and pressing. The methods
                vary from plant to plant and depend on the percentage of oil. From the discussion, it emerged that the extraction
                process is accompanied by depreciation, which harms the environment, and its disposal is accompanied by associated
                costs, which are added to the costs of the raw materials, and the ongoing growing costs of the plant. Hence, the
                existing extraction processes in the market are polluting, and expensive and don't necessarily address the problem
                of low efficiency that exists in plants such as Angelica gigas.
            </p>
            <p>In addition, in extraction processes and in particular, in refining processes, it is difficult to maintain the medicinal
                properties of the extract. This makes, plant extracts not always suitable for such products. Another issue that came
                up in the conversation is the issue of standardization and how it is carried out in practice. In the conversation
                with Rachamim, we realized that standards are completely different between the food sector, cosmetics, and medicine.
                


            </p>
            <h5>Implementation</h5>
            <p>The coversationwith Shamna helped us understand the regulatory mechanisms that exist in the western world, and what
                we'll be required to do in the field of standardization for the synthetic decursin we will produce.</p>
            <p>Yaki raised an important question - why are you trying to mimic nature? What's the point of trying to do something
                that nature already does?</p>
            <p>From his questions, we understood <b>how the project was perceived by the industry and stakeholders.</b> Yaki, as
                an industrialist, was concerned about production costs. In his opinion, even a production that "imitates" nature
                will require additional costs in energy, raw materials, and people. For him, this is an economic and not a technological
                question. Following Yaki's concern as an optional stakeholder, we concluded that a feasibility model was required,
                which would be an essential component of the work plan and would justify the <b>viability of the project.</b> Read
                about it in the <a href="{{ url_for('pages', page='implementation') }}">Proposed Implementation page</a>.</p>

          <h5>CONTEXT:</h5>
          <p>Dr. V.V. Pillay is the chief of the Poison Control Centre and head of Analytical Toxicology AIMS, Kerala. In the meeting with him, we aimed to address heavy metal poisoning caused by contaminants like lead, cadmium and chromium in humans. We wanted to understand the frequency of heavy metal poisoning, the severity in humans, and the existing treatments for heavy metal poisoning. 
            </p>
          <h5>ASSES:</h5>
           <p>To treat patients suffering from heavy metal poisoning, the first step is the analysis of body fluids, like urine or blood samples, to determine the concentration of heavy metals, including arsenic, mercury, lead, cadmium, nickel, chromium, and zinc. Chelation therapy is administered using metal-specific chelating agents like DMSA for arsenic, Edetate calcium disodium for lead, and EDTA for copper.

            
            </p>
          <h5>RESPOND: </h5>
           <p>Early detection of heavy metal poisoning is important to prevent severe health consequences. Heavy metal-caused diseases are not common but can be lethal if left untreated, depending upon the type of metal exposure. People in different regions have different levels of awareness and concern about heavy metal toxicity-related disorders. This year, our project on using biosurfactants for heavy metal removal in water bodies is seen as significant and has the potential to benefit the entire country, particularly in regions with prevalent arsenic and cadmium contamination.

            </p>
          <h5>EVALUATION: </h5>
          <p>
            From this chat with the doctor, we came to know how serious of a problem heavy metal poisoning is, and we also got the viewpoint of a medical practitioner with prior knowledge of treating the problem. This was critical in motivating our team to work on the idea and bring it to real-life application.

              assessing the negative consequences of heavy metal poisoning in Ms Rahul's case, such as abdominal pain and vomiting, which adversely affected her well-being. Our conversation with Ms. Rahul provided critical insights into the human impact of heavy metal contamination and the need for a broader community perspective. We acknowledged the ethical implications of Ms Rahul's condition and the need to adhere to health and environmental standards.
              
              </p>
              <h5>RESPOND:</h5>
              <p>We recognised the importance of Ms Rahul's input in shaping her treatment plan and her desire to raise awareness in her community. Ms Rahul's case highlighted the need for ethical and sustainable approaches to address heavy metal contamination and health challenges. This helped us further understand the scope of our project and its needs.
               </p>
               <h5>EMPLOY:</h5>
               <p>We will continuously monitor Ms Rahul's progress in her treatment and the broader impact of our response to heavy metal contamination. As we learn more about Ms Rahul's condition and the community's needs, we will adapt our approach to ensure it remains effective.

  <h5>Contribution</h5>
  <p>We approached Dr. Yehezkeli to assist us with finding an assay to measure produced decursin. We were offered to use NMR which will be faster
      than HPLC. We were also given input about how should we extract our product from the bacterial culture. </p>

  <h5>Implementation</h5>
  <p>Eventually, after discussing the matter with several people from the Yehezeli lab, we decided not to use NMR mainly
      because using it require larger concentrations than we anticipate, it's noisier in comparison to HPLC and we were
      able to have a working HPLC program that produces distinct peaks.</p>

              Project’s focus:- To show rhamnolipids are capable of forming micelles around metal ions and hydrocarbons
              
             </p>
             <h5>ASSES:</h5>
             <p>For the current situation, the team has been struggling with finding the 3D structure of biosurfactants and, even when found, had struggled in using the default forcefield parameters on GROMACS. These issues were addressed in our meeting with Dr Parimal at the All India iGEM Meet (AIIM).
              
              </p>
              <h5>RESPOND:</h5>
              <p>He suggested using the Avogadro software to be used for the conversion of any 2D .sdf structure from PubChem to 3D using the inbuilt “Auto Optimise” tool. Though not 100 % correct, it produces a good enough approximation. The available force fields on GROMACS aren’t always sufficient for a molecule. So, a new force field needed to be generated specific to the molecule. For this, he suggested using the CHARMM Generate Force Field (CGenFF) server. He also referred us to some of the research papers which had well-documented sections for their simulation setup. Using ANTECHAMBER from AMBER for the setup of the simulation was suggested as a backup if the above process didn’t work.
               </p>
               <h5>EMPLOY:</h5>
               <p>Dr. Parimal’s suggestions prompted us to look beyond what we were planning on achieving. It helped us gain more insight into better inculcation of Simulation studies into our project. Many of our issues were resolved with the help of his suggestions, and we also modified some of our system-building processes by taking insights from his feedback.

  <h5>Contribution</h5>
  <p>We approached Dr. Yehezkeli to assist us with finding an assay to measure produced decursin. We were offered to use NMR which will be faster
      than HPLC. We were also given input about how should we extract our product from the bacterial culture. </p>

  <h5>Implementation</h5>
  <p>Eventually, after discussing the matter with several people from the Yehezeli lab, we decided not to use NMR mainly
      because using it require larger concentrations than we anticipate, it's noisier in comparison to HPLC and we were
      able to have a working HPLC program that produces distinct peaks.</p>

            <p>We collaborated with Prof. Ashok Pandey, a Toxicology expert, to address the increasing cases of heavy metal poisoning in humans. Discussions with the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) revealed industry non-compliance with government directives along riverbanks. Recognizing the ineffectiveness of appealing to these industries, we took the initiative to reduce heavy metal concentrations ourselves. Furthermore, a survey we conducted highlighted the public's limited awareness of government norms related to the issue, underscoring our dedication to mitigating the problem.

            <p>Our discussions with local residents, who rely on the river and its fish for their livelihood, brought to light their growing concerns. They've noticed an alarming increase in deformities and unattractive appearances of fish from the Yamuna River, which they use for daily needs without adequate purification, intensifying the impact of heavy metal poisoning. However, there's a significant lack of awareness among the locals regarding the role of heavy metals in this issue. To address this, our Education and Outreach and Human Practices teams are dedicated to raising awareness among citizens.</p>
